- The school with the largest budget is a district school

- Charter schools which are smaller in size and have a smaller budget have higher 
percentages for both reading and math.
![Type_Summary](Type_Summary.png)
- Per student spending doesn't guarantee better overall passing scores however higher 
ranges ($630-644 and $645-675) equate to high reading scores.
- The lower spending per student generates the highest reading, math scores which equal higher overall passing percentage.
- Charter schools have the best scores in reading and math.
